# 100 Days of Code

Started this repo on **10/10/2025** — technically I'm starting on **Day 16** because the first 15 days were super basic and not worth pushing.

Main goal here is just to **track my progress**, dump some code, and keep the momentum going. Might do and push multiple "days" in a single day — not really sticking to strict rules, just trying to stay consistent-ish.

Don’t expect anything too polished, this is mostly for me.  
Feel free to lurk tho
